# ICAPS-ICRA Summer School on Plan-Based Control for Robotic Agents

The 11th edition of the International Summer School on Planning and Scheduling will be held in conjuction with ICAPS and ICRA in Paris, France in June 2020. The summer school is aimed at graduate students and young researchers in topics relevant to both conferences. The learning outcomes of the school will help the students understand better how to apply AI methods to robotic systems, and provide experience in both the theoretical background and practical application of AI Planning in the control of robots.

The Summer School consist of both lectures and hands-on sessions across 5 days hosted by Softbank Robotics, providing the unique opportunity to engage in practical experience with robotic systems. The lecture topics provide the foundations of AI Planning, task and motion planning, and many of the key challenges that are encountered in systems that seek to integrate planning and exection on-board robots.

### School Programme and Speakers

The 2020 ICAPS-ICRA Summer School on Plan-Based Control for Robotic Agents will provide students with the opportunity to learn about both the foundations and recent developments in exciting research areas in AI Planning and Scheduling and Robotics. There are planned lectures as well as hands-on sessions. The courses will cover planning basics, task and motion planning, planning with robotic uncertainty, time-constrained planning, and complete robot planning systems.

Following the succes of the previous editions of the summer school, the aim of this edition is to bring together the fields of AI and Robotics. Lectures will be given by top subject experts from the Planning, Scheduling, and Robotics research communities.

The summer school will start on 8 June around 10:00 CET and last until 12 June around 16:30 CET.

### Application Procedure

Applicants must submit the following documents, merged into one PDF and in this order:

- Completed ICAPS Summer School application form
- A letter describing how the applicant's research topic is connected to the school. This can be light-weight. The purpose of the letter is for the school chairs to be able to confirm, at a high level, that the school content is in principle suited to your background and research.
- CV
- A recommendation letter from the applicant's research advisor(s), required only if the applicant is applying for a grant - see below. This is a light-weight letter, that should merely say a few words (< 1/2 page) regarding the student's status, promise, and benefits from the school. It can be either attached or emailed directly to the contact email below.
- Applications are submitted through EasyChair (upload the PDF application as a paper with title 'application ', keywords don't matter, you might need to choose three random ones).

**The deadline for applications is March 31, 2020.**

You can contact ??? in case of questions.

### Registration Fee and Grants

The registration fee is XXX EUR. It covers admission to all school lectures, coffee breaks, and lunch. Accommodation expenses are not included in this fee.

A number of grants will be offered for supporting travel, registration and accommodation. Request for such financial support should be indicated on the application form (see above). Decisions about allocation and size of the grants will be announced on XXX, 2020. Registration fee payment will be due at the registration deadline on XXX, 2020.
